This command creates or opens a note based on the given index. The index can be negative for past notes (e.g., days, weeks) or positive for future notes. A zero index corresponds to today. You can also add links to your note using the --links flag.

Examples:
  an j day --index -1  // Opens the previous day's note
  an j week --index +1  // Creates or opens the next week's note
  an j month             // Opens the current month's note (default index is 0)
  an j year              // Opens the current year's note with links
