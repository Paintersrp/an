            The 'notes' command provides a Terminal User Interface (TUI) for managing
            and interacting with your notes vault. This powerful interface allows you
            to perform various operations on your notes, including:

            - Archiving and unarchiving notes
            - Trashing and untrashing notes
            - Deleting notes
            - Opening notes in your configured editor
            - Editing note metadata and contents
            - Fuzzy finding notes by title or content
            - Viewing and managing orphan notes
            - And more!

            Use the '--view' flag to select the initial view you want to start with.
            The available views are:

            - 1. 'default': The default view showing all your notes.
            - 2. 'orphan': A view for finding and managing orphan (notes with no links to other notes).
            - 3. 'trash': A view showing trashed notes.

            Navigate through the TUI using your keyboard, and follow the on-screen
            instructions to perform various actions on your notes.
